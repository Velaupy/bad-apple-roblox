# bad-apple-roblox

made with OpenCV

to install the required python modules, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the folder

## guide:

1. open up place.rbxl in roblox studio

2. run main.py, this will start up the server needed for roblox studio to fetch the video frames from your PC

3. play-test the game in Run mode (make sure to have the console/output open to see details and information)

4. wait for studio to finish fetching all the video frames (takes ~2 minutes); after that it should start playing automatically

**any "Number of requests exceeded limit" errors are safe to ignore, the script will wait until roblox studio allows it to continue requesting data**
